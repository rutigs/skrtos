sleep.c
   - added kernel function removeFromSleep
   - removed #define MILLISECONDS_TICK as it is moved to xeroskernel.h 
   - changed spacing of extern void tick()


syscall.c
   - added the system calls syskill and sysgetcputimes

user.c
   - test scenarios added to test syskill and its abiltity to remove process
   off both the sleep and readyQs

xeroskernel.h
   - added #define of MILLISECONDS_TICK
   - added new state a process can be in STATE_RUNNING
